      <h1>baseball</h1>
      <p>baseball is my life because let say I'm mad I would hit the ball and I would be happy because it took it all out. Baseball is a team game and if you don't want to be in a team you would not like to be in a baseball that is the whole game about. I like when I play with my brother jacob because he don't like to lose so he try his best to win me but he can't but I like it and I keep playing. ooh and don't forget that I play football and bastkball you name it but I would steel love baseball for live.</p>
